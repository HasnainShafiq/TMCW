# TMCW 

This project was mainly an excuse to practice my design skills and to play around with Astro. I built the site Astro using JSX syntax and TailwindCSS for the styling. 

There's a small issue on chromium browsers where the first section divider is stretched more than it should be on mobile screens. It renders correctly on firefox. I haven't got around to resolving it yet.
