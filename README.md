# TMCW [WIP]
 
This is a work in progress. At the moment, I have made a landing page for a car valet booking service. I am in the processing of integrating a booking service so that I have a complete product. This project was mainly an excuse to practice my design skills and to play around with Astro. I built the site Astro using JSX syntax and TailwindCSS for the styling.
